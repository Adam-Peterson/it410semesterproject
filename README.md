# Project Objective
Many people express a desire to spend less and save money, but are unsure of how to proceed. The goal of this project is to create a web application that allows users to set custom categories of expenses. Examples could be items such as:
<ol>
  <li>Groceries</li>
  <li>Eating Out</li>
  <li>Gas</li>
</ol>

Once these users have created categories, they can set a dollar amount that they want to spend for the month.

Each time the user makes a purchase, they can record the purchase amount in the web app and choose the corresponding category.

The web app will then display the amount spent and amount remaining per budget category. 

This project is designed to allow users to create a budget, upload purchases, and track progress accross time.

# Built With
This project will be created as a React app.

Database will use mySql for transaction tracking. File uploads will be handled in MongoDB. 

# Additional Features
If possible, features such as graph creation and reciept uploading will be implemented.
